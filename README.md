  # Deep Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains solutions to various deep learning projects, focusing on experimentation with different architectures and techniques. Below is a brief overview of the projects and their implementations:

## Projects Overview

### 1. VAE Hyperparameter Experimentation

Experimented with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and latent space dimension to analyze their effects on the Variational Autoencoder's (VAE) performance using the MNIST dataset.

### 2. Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)

Extended the basic VAE implementation to a conditional VAE by adding a label input to both the encoder and decoder.

### 3. GAN for MRI Image Generation

Implemented a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture with a 2D CNN Generator (G) and a simple MLPNN Discriminator (D) to generate MRI images. Computed cross-entropy loss between actual images and those generated by the generator using the Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection dataset from Kaggle.

### 4. GAN for Celebrity Image Generation

Implemented a simple GAN architecture with Generator (G) and Discriminator (D) modules as 2D CNNs to generate fake celebrity images. Computed cross-entropy loss between actual images and those generated by the generator using the Face Mask Lite Dataset from Kaggle.

### 5. Impact of Latent Vector Dimension on Generator Loss

Investigated the impact of latent vector dimension on generator loss for the celebrity image generation task. Explored latent vector dimensions as multiples of the image dimension.

### 6. Impact of Data Drift on Discriminator Performance

Analyzed the impact of data drift (change in input data) on the Discriminator's performance. Specifically, introduced Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to the real data and computed discriminator loss/accuracy over 10000 epochs.
